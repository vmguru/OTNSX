# OTNSX
In an ever-changing world we rely on data, lots of it. The data itself has transformed from a by-product to the product itself. Keeping that data secure and out of the hands of anyone that isn't allowed is getting harder, since there are more systems to manage. To keep the data secure and safe companies have to conform to various laws and standards, for example "Privacy Shield" and "General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)". With the rise of more laws and market standards it can be hard to be compliant.

VMware NSX can be used with service management tooling to create a dynamic security infrastructure in which we create "Just in Time" / "Just Enough". This means for example that administrators get remote access to systems only when they actually need it. No unnecessary connections are possible, keeping the systems more secure.

OTNSX is the glue between OTRS and NSX to create the scenario described above.
